# (PART) BIOINFORMATIC PROCEDURES {-}
# About bioinformatics {#about-bioinformatics}

Bioinformatic processing of raw sequencing and mass spectrometry data is the  computational step that precedes statistical analyses and integration of multi-omic data. Through bioinformatic processing raw data are converted into meaningful bits of information, usually drastically decreasing the size of the data sets that are used for downstream analyses.

Raw sequencing and mass spectrometry-based data files used in holo-omic analyses are typically in the realm of gigabytes (Gb) or even terabytes (Tb). Many of the performed operations require large amounts of memory (some more than 1Tb), which makes it impossible to process data in personal computers. Instead, most bioinformatics tasks are performed in computational clusters with access to large amounts of memory and many CPUs and GPUs, which enable parallelising computational tasks thus speeding up data processing time.

However, for the sake of simplicity and practicality, the example datasets included in this Workbook have been considerably downscaled to enable reproducing the exercises in personal computers.

All bioinformatic analyses included in the **Holo-omics workbook** are conducted in a Unix command line Shell environment (BASH/SH). You can find the details to set-up your SHELL environment in the section [Prepare your Shell environment](#prepare-shell).
:::

## Prepare your shell environment {#prepare-shell}

If the comment chunks of the code (text after #) is creating you problems, use the following code to disable interactive comments and avoid issues when copy-pasting code:

``` {sh eval=FALSE}
setopt interactivecomments
```

### Required software {-}

Bioinformatic pipelines for processing omic data require the use of dozens of software. All the required software are listed in the conda environment installation file available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holo-omics/holo-omics.github.io/main/bin/holo-omics-env.yaml).

### Install miniconda {-}

If **conda** is not installed in your system, the first step is to install **miniconda** (a free minimal installer for conda, enough to run the bioinformatic analyses explained in the workbook). Miniconda installers for Linux, Mac and Windows operating systems can be found in the following website:
https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

Once conda or miniconda is installed in your system, you should be able to create and manage your conda environments. You can test whether conda has been succesfully installed using the following code:

``` {sh eval=FALSE}
conda -V
#> conda 22.11.1 #or whatever version you have installed
```

### Install mamba (optional) {-}

An optional  step is to install **mamba**, which is a reimplementation of the conda package manager in C++, which speeds up many of the processes. Mamba can be installed through the command line using the `conda install` option.

``` {sh eval=FALSE}
conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
```

### Create a conda environment {-}

All the bioinformatic analyses explained in this workbook will be run within an environment containing all the necessary software. The file that specifies which software to install in the environment is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holo-omics/holo-omics.github.io/main/bin/holo-omics-env.yaml), and can be retrieved using wget (as shown in the code below), or downloading from the Internet browser. If using the latter option, don't forget to provide the absolut path to the 'holo-omics-env.yaml' file in the `mamba create` command.

``` {sh eval=FALSE}
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holo-omics/holo-omics.github.io/main/bin/holo-omics-env.yaml #download installer file
conda update conda #to ensure everything is updated
conda deactivate #deactivate any conda environment before creating a new one
conda env create -f holo-omics-env.yml
rm holo-omics-env.yaml #remove installer file
```

As the environment contains dozens of softwares, the process of creating it will take a while. It is recommended to have a good Internet connection to speed-up software download. Once the installation is over, you can double-check whether the environment has been successfully created using the following script:

``` {sh eval=FALSE}
conda activate holo-omics
#> (holo-omics) anttonalberdi@Anttons-MBP ~ %
```

The (holo-omics) specifies the environment you are at. To get out of the environment use:

``` {sh eval=FALSE}
conda env list
#> base                  *  /Users/anttonalberdi/miniconda3
#> holo-omics               /Users/anttonalberdi/miniconda3/envs/holo-omics
```

### Activate the holo-omics conda environment {-}

Whenever running the holo-omic analyses explained in this workbook, it will be necessary to activate the holo-omics environment through the following command:

``` {sh eval=FALSE}
conda activate holo-omics
#> (holo-omics) anttonalberdi@Anttons-MBP ~ %
```
