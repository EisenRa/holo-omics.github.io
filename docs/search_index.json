[["index.html", "Holo-omics workbook", " Holo-omics workbook The Holo-omics workbook is a compilation of methodological procedures to generate, analyse and integrate holo-omic data, i.e., multi-omic data jointly generated from hosts and associated microbial communities [1, 2]. This resource extends the contents of the article “A practical introduction to holo-omics”, which aims at guiding researchers to the main critical steps and decision points to perform holo-omic studies. While the article focuses on discussing pros and cons of using multiple available options, the aim of the workbook is to compile protocols and pipelines to be implemented by researchers. The Holo-omics Workbook is presented in two formats: Website (https://holo-omics.github.io/) PDF document (https://holo-omics.github.io/holo-omics_workbook.pdf) These resources are presented as two of the main final outputs of the H2020 project HoloFood. More information about this EU Innovation Action that ran between 2019 and 2023 can be found in the HoloFood section in this workbook, the HoloFood Website and the CORDIS website.

The HoloFood consortium will showcase the potential of an innovative solution that holds enormous potential for optimising modern food production. Specifically, HoloFood is a framework that integrates a suite of recent analytical and technological developments, that is applicable to any major animal food production system, spanning the full production line. Thus it is as relevant for the farmers producing livestock, as it is to the associate industries such as those producing the feed and feed additives upon which the animal’s growth, quality, health and wellbeing depends. Methodological point of view With the planet’s population rapidly increasing, one of the key global challenges of this century is to secure that the growing food production is performed in a sustainable fashion and with a low-carbon signature. Hence, optimising food production is thus not only of commercial interest for companies, but also of critical importance for humanity. In the last decades, and in particular since the 2006 ban of using antibiotics to promote animal growth in the European Union, different strategies are being developed to modulate gut microbiomes aiming to improve food production, such as functional feed components or feed additives.Feed additives have been proven effective at modulating microbiomes in many animal systems, although their efficiency often exhibits large variation. The likely reason underlying such inconsistency, is the very limited knowledge we have about the specific means of action of the additives. Understanding the effect of these additives is poorly understood, because the microorganisms of interest might interact with hundreds of other microbial taxa as well as the host organism. Consequently, the procedures to improve the feed additive products are not as efficient as they could be, and it is unlikely that any truly optimal product can be found without drastically modifying the approach taken. The holo-omic approach considers the holobiont (host animal and its associated microbiota) as a single unit of action, across multiple molecular levels. ​To achieve this, HoloFood takes advantage of large variety of new technological developments that allow us to understand the interactions between the animal and their respective gut microbiome on numerous molecular levels. In addition to this genetic data, HoloFood also incorporates a lot more information to the dataset, such as physiological and health information.
