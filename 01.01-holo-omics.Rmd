# Introduction to holo-omics {#holo-omics}

Holo-omics refers to the methodological approach that jointly generates and analyses multi-omic data from hosts and associated microbial communities @Nyholm-2020.

## Omic layers {#omic-layers}

In this workbook we consider seven omic layers that require specific data generation and analysis strategies before integrating them into multi-omic statistical models:

* Nucleic acid sequencing-based
    * Host genomics - **[HG](#host-genomics)**
    * Host transcriptomics - **[HT](#host-transcriptomics)**
    * Microbial metagenomics - **[MG](#microbial-metagenomics)**
    * Microbial metatranscriptomics - **[MT](#microbial-metatranscriptomics)**

* Mass spectrometry-based
    * Host proteomics - **[HP](#host-proteomics)**
    * Microbial metaproteomics - **[MP](#microbial-metaproteomics)**
    * (Meta)metabolomics - **[ME](#meta-metabolomics)**

Acknowledging the distinct biological and structural characteristics of these seven omic layers is essential to design experiments and analytical pipelines for better solving the complex puzzle of host-microbiota interactions.
