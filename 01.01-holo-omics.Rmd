## Omic layers #{omic-layers}

In this workbook we consider seven omic layers that require specific data generation and analysis strategies before integrating them into multi-omic statistical models:

* Nucleic acid sequencing-based
    * Host genomics **(HG)**
    * Host transcriptomics **(HT)**
    * Microbial metagenomics **(MG)**
    * Microbial metatranscriptomics **(MT)**

* Mass spectrometry-based
    * Proteomics **(HP)**
    * Microbial metaproteomics **(MP)**
    * (Meta)metabolomics **(ME)**

Acknowledging the distinct biological and structural characteristics of these seven omic layers is essential to design experiments and analytical pipelines for better solving the complex puzzle of host-microbiota interactions.
