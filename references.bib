abstract = {Animals host multi-species microbial communities (microbiomes) whose properties may result from inter-species interactions; however, current understanding of host-microbiome interactions derives mostly from studies in which elucidation of microbe-microbe interactions is difficult. In exploring how \textit{Drosophila melanogaster} acquires its microbiome, we found that a microbial community influences \textit{Drosophila} olfactory and egg-laying behaviors differently than individual members. \textit{Drosophila} prefers a \textit{Saccharomyces}-\textit{Acetobacter} co-culture to the same microorganisms grown individually and then mixed, a response mainly due to the conserved olfactory receptor, \textit{Or42b. Acetobacter} metabolism of \textit{Saccharomyces-}derived ethanol was necessary, and acetate and its metabolic derivatives were sufficient, for co-culture preference. Preference correlated with three emergent co-culture properties: ethanol catabolism, a distinct volatile profile, and yeast population decline. Egg-laying preference provided a context-dependent fitness benefit to larvae. We describe a molecular mechanism by which a microbial community affects animal behavior. Our results support a model whereby emergent metabolites signal a beneficial multispecies microbiome.},

abstract = {Aquaculture will play an essential role in feeding a growing human population, but several biological challenges impede sustainable growth of production. Emerging evidence across all areas of life has revealed the importance of the intimate biological interactions between animals and their associated gut microbiota. Based on challenges in aquaculture, we leverage current knowledge in molecular biology and host microbiota interactions to propose an applied holo-omic framework that integrates molecular data including genomes, transcriptomes, epigenomes, proteomes, and metabolomes for analyzing fish and their gut microbiota as interconnected and coregulated systems. With an eye towards aquaculture, we discuss the feasibility and potential of our holo-omic framework to improve growth, health, and sustainability in any area of food production, including livestock and agriculture.}

abstract = {Summary
From ontogenesis to homeostasis, the phenotypes of complex organisms are shaped by the bidirectional interactions between the host organisms and their associated microbiota. Current technology can reveal many such interactions by combining multi-omic data from both hosts and microbes. However, exploring the full extent of these interactions requires careful consideration of study design for the efficient generation and optimal integration of data derived from (meta)genomics, (meta)transcriptomics, (meta)proteomics, and (meta)metabolomics. In this perspective, we introduce the holo-omic approach that incorporates multi-omic data from both host and microbiota domains to untangle the interplay between the two. We revisit the recent literature on biomolecular host-microbe interactions and discuss the implementation and current limitations of the holo-omic approach. We anticipate that the application of this approach can contribute to opening new research avenues and discoveries in biomedicine, biotechnology, agricultural and aquacultural sciences, nature conservation, as well as basic ecological and evolutionary research.}
