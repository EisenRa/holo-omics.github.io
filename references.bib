  abstract = "Due to the increasing throughput of current DNA sequencing
              instruments, sample multiplexing is necessary for making
              economical use of available sequencing capacities. A widely used
              multiplexing strategy for the Illumina Genome Analyzer utilizes
              sample-specific indexes, which are embedded in one of the library
              adapters. However, this and similar multiplex approaches come
              with a risk of sample misidentification. By introducing indexes
              into both library adapters (double indexing), we have developed a
              method that reveals the rate of sample misidentification within
              current multiplex sequencing experiments. With ~0.3\% these rates
              are orders of magnitude higher than expected and may severely
              confound applications in cancer genomics and other fields
              requiring accurate detection of rare variants. We identified the
              occurrence of mixed clusters on the flow as the predominant
              source of error. The accuracy of sample identification is further
              impaired if indexed oligonucleotides are cross-contaminated or if
              indexed libraries are amplified in bulk. Double-indexing
              eliminates these problems and increases both the scope and
              accuracy of multiplex sequencing on the Illumina platform.",

               communities are acquired horizontally after birth. This process
               is believed to be shaped by a combination of environmental and
               host genetic factors. We examined whether genetic variation in
               animal behavior could affect the composition of the animal's
               microbiota in different environments. The freshwater crustacean
               Daphnia magna is primarily planktonic but exhibits variation in
               the degree to which it browses in benthic sediments. We
               performed an experiment with clonal lines of D. magna showing
               different levels of sediment-browsing intensity exposed to
               either bacteria-rich or bacteria-poor sediment or whose access
               to sediments was prevented. We found that the bacterial
               composition of the environment and genotype-specific browsing
               intensity together influence the composition of the
               Daphnia-associated bacterial community. Exposure to more diverse
               bacteria did not lead to a more diverse microbiome, but greater
               abundances of environment-specific bacteria were found
               associated with host genotypes that exhibited greater browsing
               behavior. Our results indicate that, although there is a great
               deal of variation between individuals, behavior can mediate
               genotype-by-environment interaction effects on microbiome
               composition.IMPORTANCE An animal's behavior can affect its risk
               of infection, but it is not well understood how behavior affects
               microbiome composition. The aquatic crustacean Daphnia exhibits
               genetic variation in the extent to which it browses in the
               sediment at the bottoms of ponds. We show that this behavior
               affects the Daphnia microbiome, indicating that genetic
               variation among individuals may affect microbiome composition
               and the movement of bacteria in different environments.",

               achieve sufficient coverage of informative nonribosomal
               transcripts. In eukaryotic samples, this is typically achieved
               by selective oligo(dT)-priming of messenger RNAs to exclude
               ribosomal RNA (rRNA) during cDNA synthesis. However, this
               strategy is not compatible with prokaryotes in which functional
               transcripts are generally not polyadenylated. To overcome this,
               we adopted DASH (depletion of abundant sequences by
               hybridization), initially developed for eukaryotic cells, to
               improve both the sensitivity and depth of bacterial RNA-seq.
               DASH uses the Cas9 nuclease to remove unwanted cDNA sequences
               prior to library amplification. We report the design,
               evaluation, and optimization of DASH experiments for standard

               importance for experiments that try to reflect the snapshot of
               gene expression at the moment of RNA extraction. Until recently,
               there has been no reliable standard for estimating the integrity
               of RNA samples and the ratio of 28S:18S ribosomal RNA, the
               common measure for this purpose, has been shown to be
               inconsistent. The advent of microcapillary electrophoretic RNA
               separation provides the basis for an automated high-throughput
               approach, in order to estimate the integrity of RNA samples in
               an unambiguous way. METHODS: A method is introduced that
               automatically selects features from signal measurements and
               constructs regression models based on a Bayesian learning
               technique. Feature spaces of different dimensionality are
               compared in the Bayesian framework, which allows selecting a
               final feature combination corresponding to models with high
               posterior probability. RESULTS: This approach is applied to a
               large collection of electrophoretic RNA measurements recorded
               with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer to extract an algorithm that
               describes RNA integrity. The resulting algorithm is a
               user-independent, automated and reliable procedure for
               standardization of RNA quality control that allows the
               calculation of an RNA integrity number (RIN). CONCLUSION: Our
               results show the importance of taking characteristics of several
               regions of the recorded electropherogram into account in order
               to get a robust and reliable prediction of RNA integrity,
               especially if compared to traditional methods.",

               quantitatively delineating the global transcriptional profiles
               of microbes in order to gain deeper understanding of their
               physiology and function. Cost-effective bacterial RNA-seq
               requires efficient physical removal of ribosomal RNA (rRNA),
               which otherwise dominates transcriptomic reads. However, current
               methods to effectively deplete rRNA of diverse non-model
               bacterial species are lacking. Here, we describe a probe and
               ribonuclease based strategy for bacterial rRNA removal. We
               implemented the method using either chemically synthesized
               oligonucleotides or amplicon-based single-stranded DNA probes
               and validated the technique on three novel gut microbiota
               isolates from three distinct phyla. We further showed that
               different probe sets can be used on closely related species. We
               provide a detailed methods protocol, probe sets for >5000 common
               microbes from RefSeq, and an online tool to generate custom
               probe libraries. This approach lays the groundwork for

  abstract  = "In most organisms, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) contributes to >85\% of
               total RNA. Thus, to obtain useful information from
               RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses at reasonable sequencing
               depth, typically, mature polyadenylated transcripts are enriched
               or rRNA molecules are depleted. Targeted depletion of rRNA is
               particularly useful when studying transcripts lacking a poly(A)
               tail, such as some non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), most bacterial RNAs
               and partially degraded or immature transcripts. While several
               commercially available kits allow effective rRNA depletion,
               their efficiency relies on a high degree of sequence homology
               between oligonucleotide probes and the target RNA. This
               restricts the use of such kits to a limited number of organisms
               with conserved rRNA sequences. In this study we describe the use
               of biotinylated oligos and streptavidin-coated paramagnetic
               beads for the efficient and specific depletion of trypanosomal
               rRNA. Our approach reduces the levels of the most abundant rRNA
               transcripts to less than 5\% with minimal off-target effects. By
               adjusting the sequence of the oligonucleotide probes, our
               approach can be used to deplete rRNAs or other abundant
               transcripts independent of species. Thus, our protocol provides
               a useful alternative for rRNA removal where enrichment of
               polyadenylated transcripts is not an option and commercial kits
               for rRNA are not available.",
