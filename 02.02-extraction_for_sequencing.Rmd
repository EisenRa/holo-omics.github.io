# DNA/RNA extraction {#dna-rna-extraction}

Hundreds or (probably) thousands of different protocols and variations exist for extracting and purifying nucleic acids. Protocols can be classified based on methodological (e.g., chemical vs. physical DNA/RNA isolation, column-based vs bead-based, commercial vs. open-access).
